Link state routing is a technique in which each router shares the knowledge of its neighborhood with every other router i.e. the internet work.

## Features of Link State Routing Protocols
1. Link State Packet: A small packet that contains routing information. 
2. Link-State Database: A collection of information gathered from the link-state packet. 

3. Shortest Path First Algorithm (Dijkstra algorithm): A calculation performed on the database results in the shortest path 

4. Routing Table: A list of known paths and interfaces.
